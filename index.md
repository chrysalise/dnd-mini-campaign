This repository contains all reference materials, background information about the world, and periodic updates of significant events that your party has encountered during your adventures in the Nelluon Triangle. 

The Nelluon Triangle is a region within the Meropis Isles (credit: Matt Hale) that your adventures will take place in. For information about the Nelluon Triangle, important NPCs, and important societal elements relevant to your adventures, refer to the [Campaign Resources](resources.md) page. 

Since this mini-campaign takes place within the broader world of the Meropis Isles, relevant world details can be found in the [World Background](background.md) page. The details on this page are not strictly necessary for adventuring in the Nelluon Triangle, but may provide some useful context for the events happening in the campaign. 

Another useful resource to keep track of during our campaign is the [Significant Events](events.md) page. From time to time, as your party interacts with the game world, I will be logging significant world events that have happened in order to serve as useful reference material for your party to reivew if you are struggling to remember what has happened several sessions ago, as well as serve as a collection of all your significant deeds and your impact on the game world.
