## Getting Started
### Collaborative Storytelling
One of the central ideas that we will be exploring in this mini-campaign is collaborative storytelling. One way I think about this is from the perspective of a writer. As a writer, I work hard to create plot and characters that operate within this plot to develop a compelling story that sticks with the reader long after they've read my work. A big part of this process involves the interactions between characters and the world they live in. When executed well, a story like that is both a satisfying self-expression of my inner thoughts and an exciting potential interaction wtih the reader. A DnD campaign can do the same thing, but in a collaborative format. When done well, players work together to create characters, stories, and relationships that are the building blocks of a strong narrative. This requires that players are willing to work with one another to create these links with each others' characters and the world. 

Thus, as a DM, I consider myself responsible for the following during the campaign:
- Building a rich and intersting world that affords many different forms of interactions by the characters.
- Creating effects in the world based on player interactions. That is, adapting the world to your choices.
- Advancing the narrative of the story as well as I can based on your actions.

Similarly, as a player, I consider these your responsibilities:
- Considering your characters' motivations, values, needs, desires, and prefereces. These form the foundation for robust character interactions and help guide your actions during the game. 
- Articulating your characters' actions, speech, and in some cases, intent, so that I may adapt the world based on what your character is doing. 
- Interacting with the world and other characters. Nothing will happen if your character does nothing. So do something. 

### Creating a Character
Here is the bare minimum of what you'll need to create a new character:
- Head to our [DnD Beyond campaign link](https://ddb.ac/campaigns/join/2409669417393835) to join it and create a new character. Do not worry about fleshing all the details out now. Just create a shell. You can edit it later. 
- Work out a character backstory. Refer to the [Story setup](# Story Setup) section of this page to understand the context that your characters are starting in, the relationships between characters, other structures forces at work, and the overall mood or theme of the campaign.
