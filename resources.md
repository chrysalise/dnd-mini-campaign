## Getting Started
### Collaborative Storytelling
One of the central ideas that we will be exploring in this mini-campaign is collaborative storytelling. One way I think about this is from the perspective of a writer. As a writer, I work hard to create plot and characters that operate within this plot to develop a compelling story that sticks with the reader long after they've read my work. A big part of this process involves the interactions between characters and the world they live in. When executed well, a story like that is both a satisfying self-expression of my inner thoughts and an exciting potential interaction wtih the reader. A DnD campaign can do the same thing, but in a collaborative format. When done well, players work together to create characters, stories, and relationships that are the building blocks of a strong narrative. This requires that players are willing to work with one another to create these links with each others' characters and the world. 

Thus, as a DM, I consider myself responsible for the following during the campaign:
- Building a rich and intersting world that affords many different forms of interactions by the characters.
- Creating effects in the world based on player interactions. That is, adapting the world to your choices.
- Advancing the narrative of the story as well as I can based on your actions.

Similarly, as a player, I consider these your responsibilities:
- Considering your characters' motivations, values, needs, desires, and prefereces. These form the foundation for robust character interactions and help guide your actions during the game. 
- Articulating your characters' actions, speech, and in some cases, intent, so that I may adapt the world based on what your character is doing. 
- Interacting with the world and other characters. Nothing will happen if your character does nothing. So do something. 

### Creating a Character
Here is the bare minimum of what you'll need to create a new character:
- Head to our [DnD Beyond campaign link](https://ddb.ac/campaigns/join/2409669417393835) to join it and create a new character. Do not worry about fleshing all the details out now. Just create a shell. You can edit it later. 
- Work out a character backstory. Refer to the [Story Setting](#story-setting) section of this page to understand the context that your characters are starting in, the relationships between characters, other structures forces at work, and the overall mood or theme of the campaign. Use these details to develop some ideas for interesting motivations that your character might have, some details about your character that fit will within this setting, and potential links with other entities or events mentioned. These details do not need to be fully coherent or set in stone. Consult with me about these ideas you have so that we may collaboratively work out how to create a compelling character that fits within the general story that I have planned for this mini-campaign.
- Explore several ideas for the type of character you would like to play during our campaign. This is somewhat unrelated to backstory, but there are obviously some character types that work well with certain kinds of backstories (e.g., a rogue that was born a streetrat in a dense urban environment is good at lockpicking, sleight of hand, and deception). However, the class and to some extent the race of your character can make a big difference in your day-to-day interactions with other characters in the game and in the actions that will be easier or harder for you to perform. Do you tend to prefer ranged combat vs. getting into melee? Do you prefer to sweet talk your way out of a sticky situation vs. intimidating or beating the crap out of anyone that gets in your way? Are you willing to manage spell slots or would you prefer to enter combat with many actions available? Thinking about these choices now will make character development a little easier. It may also be helpful to share the character type you are interested in creating with the rest of the players since some players prefer to make characters that round out the abilities of a party.
- Each character will either start out at level 2. That means that if you want to multi-class, you can put one level into each of your classes, or if you are only using a single class, then you may gain two levels in that class. 
- Each character will use the default starting equipment for your character class and background [found in DnD Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes), but if you would like to include additional items or equipment relevant to your character backstory, then let me know and we can work out something interesting. 
- When we meet for Session 0, we will roll your character stats according to the method used by Matt Hale in his Isles of Meropis main campaign: 
> Roll 4d6, sum the top 3 rolls and record the number. Do this 6 times, writing the ‘attribute array’ down. Now roll a second set. Choose the first or second set of 6 numbers. I recommend keeping either the set with the greatest total modifier (the largest sum across all numbers) or the set with the greatest single score (e.g. if you roll a set with an 18). These 6 numbers are your starting attribute scores, you can assign any of the numbers to any attribute in your character sheet.

### Story Setting
This mini-campaign takes place in the Nelluon Triangle region east of the Isles of Meropis region in the world of Alfheimr. The history of this world is vast, with many implications from previous campaigns played in this world. For details about historical timelines, major world events, and current politcal conditions, refer to this [campaign primer written by Matt Hale](https://github.com/chrysalise/dnd-mini-campaign/blob/f1bf417fdf284e90607bf56ead8f71177d873497/dnd-uno-primer-campaign.pdf). 

Reading this earlier primer will help with underestanding the world that this campaign takes place in, but here are some highlights that are important from that primer:
- Virtually all cities and states are under the control of the New Arklan Imperium, led by Kurgal, a necromancer Litch supreme ruler. Under their rule, necromantic practices become the norm, and "long life" clinics help individuals with ternimal illnesses stay alive. However, as time passes, those who die a mortal death tend to come back as "zombies" who can contribute to society in the form of menial labor (e.g., rowing boats) for around 5-7 years. 
- In the area of the world that this mini-campaign takes place in, Elves are the most dominant civilization at play. The large country of Valance is home to High Elves and is general North of where the Isles of Meropis is. 
- The Meropis Isles are a series of islands that have historically been rather lawless, home to pirates, thieves, and outcasts, but has since fallen under the control of the Chronus Concord, a regional power mostly interested in establishing trade in the region, taming the lawlesness that has plagued these isles, and is now affiliated with the Imperium. The Chronus Concord doesn't "rule" over these Islands with an iron fist, and much illegal activity still goes on in these isles. Of note, are the pirates that roam the seas and make their home in Darktide's Wake, and the Manifold, a large and powerful criminal organization (e.g., the Mafia of the Isles).

- The native people of the Spice Islands are the Keke'huna. Not much is known about their connection to the Nelluon Triangle where this mini-campaign takes place, but their ties to the region run deep, and there are many secrets in these lands that they hold the key to.

#### The Nelluon Triangle
The region that you were will adventuring in is colloquially known as the Nelluon Triangle (from the Elvish word for "hidden"). The exact location, georgaphy, and ecosystem of this region is largely unknown to this day, but scholars have pinpointed the general location East of the Aera Floating Islands (off the map above) as the most likely home of such a region. This area of the world is unmapped, and numerous scouting expeditions have failed to properly identify the immediate area east of Aera. The far east areas beyond the Isles of Meropis is known to be wide open sea. However, several anecdotal accounts of these scouting parties have reported the "appearance" of a vague landmass spotted in an area of the ocean that has historically believed to be uninhabited. Similar stories of an ephemeral series of islands have been told by the Keke'huna in their oral tradition, but the exact nature of these hidden island remains a mystery. 

More modern expeditions (within the last 200 years) into that region have failed in 1 of 3 ways:
- the expedition doesn't return- they are nowhere to be found,
- a member of the expedition attempts to send a message back to the Isles of Meropis via magical means (e.g., sending) but the message is so garbled or confusing that the only snippets that have ever been retrieved from these messages are along the lines of "--unbelievable land formations--", "--creatures beyond comprehension--", or "--send help immediately--", and 
- remnants of body parts identified as belonging to a member of the expedition are found floating among ship debris washed up on the Wild Isles or on the coast of Faerunear. 

Because of the extremely unsuccessful and dangerous nature of these expeditions, most efforts to map out this region have tapered off within the last 50 years. Once in awhile, a drunk pirate in a local tavern may recount the "tale of the lost city of gold", and may brag about their next adventure plundering the riches of this mysterious region, but most of that is just talk. Even hardened adventurers stay away from that region because of the risk of dissapearing forever.

Years pass, and what was once a promising area for exploration and plundering has now faded in the collective conciousness of the region. Promises of untold wealth left behind by an ancient civilization have dissolved in the fullness of time, giving way to a cloud of apathy about what goes on in the Nelluon Triangle. If brought up now in serious conversation, most shrug it off as "ghost stories from the sea", "a pointless waste of life and gold". 

Until now.
