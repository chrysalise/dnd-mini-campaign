## Getting Started
### Collaborative Storytelling
One of the central ideas that we will be exploring in this mini-campaign is collaborative storytelling. One way I think about this is from the perspective of a writer. As a writer, I work hard to create plot and characters that operate within this plot to develop a compelling story that sticks with the reader long after they've read my work. A big part of this process involves the interactions between characters and the world they live in. When executed well, a story like that is both a satisfying self-expression of my inner thoughts and an exciting potential interaction wtih the reader. A DnD campaign can do the same thing, but in a collaborative format. When done well, players work together to create characters, stories, and relationships that are the building blocks of a strong narrative. This requires that players are willing to work with one another to create these links with each others' characters and the world. 

Thus, as a DM, I consider myself responsible for the following during the campaign:
- Building a rich and intersting world that affords many different forms of interactions by the characters.
- Creating effects in the world based on player interactions. That is, adapting the world to your choices.
- Advancing the narrative of the story as well as I can based on your actions.

Similarly, as a player, I consider these your responsibilities:
- Considering your characters' motivations, values, needs, desires, and prefereces. These form the foundation for robust character interactions and help guide your actions during the game. 
- Articulating your characters' actions, speech, and in some cases, intent, so that I may adapt the world based on what your character is doing. 
- Interacting with the world and other characters. Nothing will happen if your character does nothing. So do something. 

### Creating a Character
Here is the bare minimum of what you'll need to create a new character:
- Head to our [DnD Beyond campaign link](https://ddb.ac/campaigns/join/2409669417393835) to join it and create a new character. Do not worry about fleshing all the details out now. Just create a shell. You can edit it later. 
- Work out a character backstory. Refer to the [Story Setting](#story-setting) section of this page to understand the context that your characters are starting in, the relationships between characters, other structures forces at work, and the overall mood or theme of the campaign. Use these details to develop some ideas for interesting motivations that your character might have, some details about your character that fit will within this setting, and potential links with other entities or events mentioned. These details do not need to be fully coherent or set in stone. Consult with me about these ideas you have so that we may collaboratively work out how to create a compelling character that fits within the general story that I have planned for this mini-campaign.
- Explore several ideas for the type of character you would like to play during our campaign. This is somewhat unrelated to backstory, but there are obviously some character types that work well with certain kinds of backstories (e.g., a rogue that was born a streetrat in a dense urban environment is good at lockpicking, sleight of hand, and deception). However, the class and to some extent the race of your character can make a big difference in your day-to-day interactions with other characters in the game and in the actions that will be easier or harder for you to perform. Do you tend to prefer ranged combat vs. getting into melee? Do you prefer to sweet talk your way out of a sticky situation vs. intimidating or beating the crap out of anyone that gets in your way? Are you willing to manage spell slots or would you prefer to enter combat with many actions available? Thinking about these choices now will make character development a little easier.
